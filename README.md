# Script-For-Honor
This script was made strictly for a personal project, and I only used it against the bot in Practice Mode!!!

DirectInputs.py - is taken from the internet and used by the Interactiune.py script for keyboard/mouse commands. 
Interactiune.py - contains methods for some basic actions: Attack, Guard, Parry. 
ScriptForHonor.py - is the main file. It uses computer vision for detecting the opponent's guard and attack indicators, and the aforementioned scripts to interact with it. It is still a work in progress as I encountered issues with the neural network.
